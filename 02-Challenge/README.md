# Refactoring-code
1. For the assignment we were given HTML and CSS code to refactor. We were asked to make sure all the links worked and that the page
still looked the same. 

I switched some divs to nav in the HTML to allow the links to click down. I also changed the web title. I eliminated any reduntant code. 
When I was finished with the html I made sure the page still deployed in the default browser. After this, I moved on to the css code.

For the CSS I noticed alot of lines that could be condensed to speed up the website, and make it easier to read for others. Mainly in H3. 
After doing this I deployed the web page and it worked.
